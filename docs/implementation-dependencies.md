# Implementation Dependencies and Parallelization Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the dependencies between implementation tasks and provides strategies for parallel development to optimize the development timeline.

**Total Estimated Effort:** 185 hours across 3 phases  
**Sequential Timeline:** ~4.5 weeks (1 developer @ 40 hours/week)  
**Optimized Timeline:** ~2.5-3 weeks (2 developers with parallelization)

---

## Phase 1: Core Schema & Storage (Week 1)

**Total Effort:** 47 hours  
**Optimized Duration:** 25-30 hours with 2 developers

### Task Dependencies

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Define TypeScript Schemas<br/>9 hours] --> B[Implement Storage Layer<br/>12 hours]
    A --> C[Create Sample Fixtures<br/>11 hours]
    A --> D[Write Unit Tests<br/>15 hours]
    B --> E[Phase 2 Start]
    C --> E
    D --> E
```

### Dependency Details

| Task | Duration | Depends On | Can Parallel With |
|------|----------|------------|-------------------|
| **1. Define TypeScript Schemas** | 9 hours | None (foundation) | Nothing - must complete first |
| **2. Implement Storage Layer** | 12 hours | Schemas | Fixtures, Tests |
| **3. Create Sample Fixtures** | 11 hours | Schemas | Storage, Tests |
| **4. Write Unit Tests** | 15 hours | Schemas | Storage, Fixtures |

### Parallelization Strategy

**Day 1-2 (Sequential):**
- Complete Schemas (9 hours) - **CRITICAL PATH**

**Day 3-5 (Parallel):**
- **Developer A:** Storage Layer (12 hours)
- **Developer B:** Fixtures (11 hours) + start Tests (4 hours)

**Day 6-7 (Parallel):**
- **Developer A:** Complete Storage, help with Tests
- **Developer B:** Complete Tests (11 hours remaining)

### Critical Notes

- **Schemas are the foundation** - everything else depends on these type definitions
- Storage and Fixtures can proceed independently once schemas are defined
- Tests can start early by testing schema validation rules directly

## Phase 2: Questionnaire Runner (Week 2)

**Total Effort:** 68 hours  
**Optimized Duration:** 35-40 hours with 2 developers

### Task Dependencies

```mermaid
graph TD
    P1[Phase 1 Complete] --> A[Build TUI Components<br/>18 hours]
    P1 --> B[Implement Flow Logic<br/>18 hours]
    A --> C[Add Validation & Error Handling<br/>16 hours]
    B --> D[Implement Response Persistence<br/>16 hours]
    C --> P3[Phase 3 Start]
    D --> P3
```

### Dependency Details

| Task | Duration | Depends On | Can Parallel With | Blocks |
|------|----------|------------|-------------------|--------|
| **1. Build TUI Components** | 18 hours | Schemas, Fixtures | Flow Logic | Validation |
| **2. Implement Flow Logic** | 18 hours | Schemas, Storage | Components | Persistence |
| **3. Add Validation & Error Handling** | 16 hours | Schemas, Components | Persistence (initially) | Phase 3 |
| **4. Implement Response Persistence** | 16 hours | Storage, Flow Logic | Validation (initially) | Phase 3 |

### Parallelization Strategy

**Week 2, Days 1-4 (Parallel):**
- **Developer A:** TUI Components (18 hours)
  - Build all question type components
  - Component factory and base classes
  - Visual styling and formatting
  
- **Developer B:** Question Flow Logic (18 hours)
  - Flow engine implementation
  - Navigation system
  - State management
  - Session handling

**Week 2, Days 5-8 (Parallel):**
- **Developer A:** Validation & Error Handling (16 hours)
  - Requires: Components completed
  - Input validation for all types
  - Cross-question validation
  - Error UI components
  
- **Developer B:** Response Persistence (16 hours)
  - Requires: Flow Logic completed
  - Response builder
  - Incremental saves
  - Session recovery

### Critical Notes

- **Components and Flow Logic** are largely independent and can be built in parallel
- **Validation needs Components** to integrate UI validation feedback
- **Persistence needs Flow Logic** to understand state and session management
- Both validation and persistence should be completed before Phase 3 starts

## Phase 3: Advanced Features (Week 3)

**Total Effort:** 70 hours  
**Optimized Duration:** 35-40 hours with 2 developers

### Task Dependencies

```mermaid
graph TD
    P2[Phase 2 Complete] --> A[Conditional Logic Engine<br/>18 hours]
    P2 --> B[Response Viewing & Analytics<br/>18 hours]
    P2 --> C[Export Functionality<br/>18 hours]
    A --> D[Polish & Error Handling<br/>16 hours]
    B --> D
    C --> D
```

### Dependency Details

|------|----------|------------|-------------------|--------|
| **1. Conditional Logic Engine** | 18 hours | Schemas, Flow Logic | Analytics, Export | Polish |
| **2. Response Viewing & Analytics** | 18 hours | Storage, Persistence | Conditional Logic, Export | Polish |
| **3. Export Functionality** | 18 hours | Storage, Persistence | Conditional Logic, Analytics | Polish |
| **4. Polish & Error Handling** | 16 hours | ALL tasks above | Nothing - integration work | Release |

### Parallelization Strategy

**Week 3, Days 1-4 (Parallel - High Independence):**
- **Developer A:** Conditional Logic Engine (18 hours)
  - Expression parser
  - Evaluation engine
  - Conditional functions
  - Dependency graph
  
- **Developer B:** Response Viewing & Analytics (18 hours)
  - Response viewing service
  - Analytics engine
  - Statistical calculations
  - Visualization components

**Week 3, Days 5-6 (Parallel/Sequential):**
- **Developer A:** Export Functionality (18 hours)
  - JSON, CSV, Excel, PDF exporters
  - Export templates
  - Export scheduling
  
- **Developer B:** Continue Analytics or start Polish prep
  - Finish analytics features

## Critical Path Analysis

### Overall Critical Path

The longest dependent chain through the project:

```
Schemas (9h)
  → Storage (12h)
    → Flow Logic (18h)
      → Persistence (16h)
        → Analytics (18h)
          → Export (18h)
            → Polish (16h)

Total Critical Path: 107 hours
```

### Parallel Opportunities

Tasks that can run parallel to critical path:

```
Parallel Track 1:
Schemas (9h) → Fixtures (11h) → Tests (15h) → Components (18h) → Validation (16h) → Conditional Logic (18h)

Parallel Track 2:
Schemas (9h) → Storage (12h) → Flow Logic (18h) → Persistence (16h) → Analytics (18h) → Polish (16h)
```

**Optimal Strategy:** Run 2 parallel tracks with periodic synchronization points

## Resource Allocation Recommendations

### Single Developer Approach

**Timeline:** 4.5-5 weeks (185 hours)

**Sequence:**
1. Week 1: Phase 1 (47 hours)
   - Day 1-2: Schemas
   - Day 3-4: Storage
   - Day 5: Fixtures
   - Day 6-7: Tests

2. Week 2: Phase 2 (68 hours, will overflow)
   - Day 1-4: Components
   - Day 5-7: Flow Logic
   
3. Week 3: Phase 2 completion + Phase 3 start
   - Day 1-3: Validation & Persistence
   - Day 4-7: Conditional Logic + Analytics start

4. Week 4: Phase 3 completion
   - Day 1-4: Complete Analytics, Export
   - Day 5-7: Polish

5. Week 5: Buffer and integration

### Two Developer Approach (Recommended)

**Timeline:** 2.5-3 weeks (100-110 hours per developer)

**Week 1:**
- **Dev A:** Schemas (9h) → Storage (12h) → Support Tests
- **Dev B:** Wait for Schemas → Fixtures (11h) + Tests (15h)

**Week 2:**
- **Dev A:** Components (18h) → Validation (16h)
- **Dev B:** Flow Logic (18h) → Persistence (16h)

**Week 3:**
- **Dev A:** Conditional Logic (18h) → Export (18h)
- **Dev B:** Analytics (18h) → Assist with Export/Polish
- **Both:** Polish (16h combined)

### Three+ Developer Approach

**Not Recommended** - Diminishing returns due to:
- High coordination overhead
- Many sequential dependencies
- Risk of integration conflicts
- Most tasks are designed for 1-2 people

**If required:**
- 3rd developer can focus on documentation, testing, and tooling
- DevOps and CI/CD pipeline setup
- Performance testing and optimization
- Additional fixture creation

---

## Risk Mitigation

### High-Risk Dependencies

1. **Storage Layer** (Phase 1)
   - Risk: Foundation for all persistence
   - Mitigation: Complete with comprehensive tests before Phase 2
   - Testing: Unit tests + integration tests with file system

2. **Flow Logic** (Phase 2)
   - Risk: Complex state management, affects multiple features
   - Mitigation: Extensive testing with fixtures, consider state machine patterns
   - Testing: State transition tests, session recovery tests

3. **Response Persistence** (Phase 2)
   - Risk: Multiple dependencies, data integrity critical
   - Mitigation: Don't start until Flow Logic is solid and tested
   - Testing: Data corruption scenarios, concurrent access tests

### Synchronization Points

**After Phase 1:**
- Team sync to review schemas and storage
- Validate fixtures work correctly
- Confirm test coverage is adequate

**Mid Phase 2:**
- After Components + Flow Logic complete
- Integration testing before starting Validation + Persistence
- Ensure Components and Flow work together

**After Phase 2:**
- Major integration checkpoint
- End-to-end testing of questionnaire execution
- Confirm all persistence scenarios work

**Mid Phase 3:**
- After Conditional Logic + Analytics complete
- Test complex conditional scenarios
- Validate analytics calculations

**Before Release:**
- Complete integration testing
- Performance testing under load
- Security review
- Documentation review
