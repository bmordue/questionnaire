# Decision Log

This document tracks key architectural and design decisions made during the development of the questionnaire application.

## Decision Format

For each decision, we document:
- **Decision**: What was decided
- **Date**: When the decision was made
- **Context**: Why this decision was needed
- **Rationale**: The reasoning behind the decision
- **Status**: Current status (Proposed, Accepted, Superseded, Deprecated)
- **Consequences**: Expected outcomes and trade-offs

## Decisions

### ADR-001: Multiple Storage Backends Support

**Decision**: No - We will not support multiple storage backends

**Date**: 2025-10-27

**Context**: Decision needed on whether to abstract storage layer to support multiple backends (e.g., file system, database, cloud storage)

**Rationale**: 
- Simplicity over flexibility for initial implementation
- Single storage backend reduces complexity and maintenance overhead
- Can be revisited if requirements change in the future

**Status**: Accepted

**Consequences**: 
- Faster initial development
- Less complex codebase
- May require refactoring if storage requirements change

### ADR-002: User Authentication and Multi-tenancy

**Decision**: No - We will not implement user authentication or multi-tenancy

**Date**: 2025-10-27

**Context**: Decision needed on whether to support multiple users and tenant isolation

**Rationale**: 
- Current requirements don't indicate need for user management
- Reduces complexity significantly
- Faster time to market
- Can be added later if needed

**Status**: Accepted

**Consequences**: 
- Single-user or open-access application
- No user-specific data isolation
- Simpler security model
- May need significant refactoring to add later

### ADR-003: Response Encryption at Rest

**Decision**: No - Responses will not be encrypted at rest

**Date**: 2025-10-27

**Context**: Decision needed on whether to encrypt stored questionnaire responses

**Rationale**: 
- No sensitive personal data expected in questionnaire responses
- Reduces implementation complexity
- Avoids key management overhead
- Standard file system permissions provide basic protection

**Status**: Accepted

**Consequences**: 
- Responses stored in plain text/JSON format
- Easier debugging and data inspection
- Simpler backup and recovery
- May need to revisit if sensitive data requirements emerge
